# Quantum Mechanics Thought Experiment

The underlying promise chain could be built up recursively without generator functions, but the nuance is that the decision tree is pre-built, all-at-once, synchronously. This is analogous to the many-worlds interpretation in physics where all possible futures already exist, whereas the lazily appending to the promise chain via the generator functions is "collapse of the wave function".
